This console application allows you to keep all of your passwords in one safe place. Passwords are split into 3 categories (so it's easy to organise them) and
app is very easy to use (everything you want to know is displayed on screen). The only thing you have to know is you safe password (in the app it is 123456, but you can change it
while using application). 

!!!IMPORTANT!!!
Add .txt (you can also add json files) files included in GitHub to bin/Debug/net8.0 so the app will properly(there are some passwords already in the files just to show from start how this app works)
